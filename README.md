# lis-project
The project is an overview of my Spotify
It's an overview of my general top playlists, artists, genres, and songs
  it includes many of the visualizations from the Spotify analysis tools available online
This is a great way to practice intermediate HTML skills that were not assigned but are super easy and the make the userface more accessible
