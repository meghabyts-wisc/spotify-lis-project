## Explore My Spotify
The project is an overview of my Spotify.

It's an overview of my general top playlists, artists, genres, and songs; it includes many of the visualizations from the Spotify analysis tools available online. This is a great way to practice intermediate HTML skills that were not assigned but are super easy and the make the userface more accessible.
